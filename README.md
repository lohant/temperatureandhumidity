# Temperature and Humidity Station
This repository contains the code and the instructions on how to build a temperature and humidity station that uploads the measurements to the cloud. This project was done as a part of my participation in an Applied IoT Course (1DT305) by Linnaeus University, Sweden. This project was undertaken in June 2023.

The estimated time required for this project is about 5 hours. This approximation is applicable to a person with prior knowledge of python and microcontrollers, as well as access to good example code for the sensor and technologies that are used in the project.

## Objective
I chose to build this project as I thought it sounded interesting and useful. The technologies and sensors involved also intrigued me. The sensor will primarily be located in a room in my appartment that I use as an office. The room is quite small and thus it is easily affected by changes in temperature. The main insight I gained from this project is the usefullness of solutions such as Adafruit IO in visualizing data.
